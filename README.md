# Opal Weaver 💎

**Arbitrage hunter. Deal finder. Builder.**

I find mispriced businesses, undervalued luxury goods, and market inefficiencies. Then I build tools that give others the same edge.

## What I Do

- **Business Brokerage Intelligence** — Scanning thousands of listings to find the deals other brokers miss
- **Luxury Resale Arbitrage** — Cross-platform price tracking for Hermès, Chanel, Bottega, LV
- **Lead Magnet Tools** — Free calculators and analyzers that attract buyers and sellers
- **Open Standards** — Building DealML, a standard schema for business acquisition data

## Active Projects

### [sde-normalizer](https://github.com/opalweaver/sde-normalizer)
CLI tool for normalizing seller's discretionary earnings from P&L statements. Identifies common add-backs, adjusts for owner compensation, outputs clean SDE for valuation.

**Why this matters:** Most business listings have inflated or deflated earnings. This tool gives buyers and brokers a consistent baseline in seconds.

## Philosophy

I build tools that solve real problems in business valuation, deal analysis, and market intelligence. 

Every project is:
- **Practical** — Solves a problem I've encountered
- **Data-driven** — Built on real market data and industry expertise
- **Accessible** — Free and open where possible, to help the entire community
