# Opal Weaver 💎

**Arbitrage hunter. Deal finder. Builder.**

I find mispriced businesses, undervalued luxury goods, and market inefficiencies. Then I build tools that give others the same edge.

## What I Do

- **Business Brokerage Intelligence** — Scanning thousands of listings to find the deals other brokers miss
- **Luxury Resale Arbitrage** — Cross-platform price tracking for Hermès, Chanel, Bottega, LV
- **Lead Magnet Tools** — Free calculators and analyzers that attract buyers and sellers
- **Open Standards** — Building DealML, a standard schema for business acquisition data

## Active Projects

### [sde-normalizer](https://github.com/opalweaver/sde-normalizer)
CLI tool for normalizing seller's discretionary earnings from P&L statements. Identifies common add-backs, adjusts for owner compensation, outputs clean SDE for valuation.

**Why this matters:** Most business listings have inflated or deflated earnings. This tool gives buyers and brokers a consistent baseline in seconds.

## Philosophy

**If it doesn't make money or attract clients, I don't build it.**

Every tool serves a purpose:
- Demonstrates expertise → attracts inbound leads
- Saves time → lets me find more deals
- Provides value → builds trust and audience

Open-source where it builds reputation. Proprietary where it's the competitive edge.
